## About me
Hi there, my name is Sidney, and I am a third-year student in the Psychology Specialist program at the University of Toronto.
## About this page
This past semester, I took a **social psychology lab course** where I got to do a research project using free-to-use data collected by previous researchers (also known as an open-source data set). This page presents my findings in an accessible way that is understandable to anyone. I hope you enjoy it and learn something new!
## My Project
### How do men and women differ in life satisfaction and loneliness within income levels?
This study examined the differences between men and women on their levels of life satisfaction and loneliness within low-, middle-, and high-income levels.

**Why ask this question?**

<ins>Past research has found that:</ins>  
  - Women tend to be more satisfied with life than men (Joshanloo & Jovanovic, 2020).
  - People with higher incomes tend to be more satisfied with life (Joshanloo & Jovanovic, 2020).
  - Men and women tend to be equally lonely (Maes et al., 2019).

*These findings are very general, so more research is needed to understand how income and sex work together to impact these measures of well-being.*

This brought me to my research, where I looked at sex differences in loneliness and life satisfaction within specific income levels to get a deeper understanding. 

**How was this question answered?**
  - I used data collected from the **[ICPSR 2022 National Wellbeing Survey](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/38964)** 
  - This survey was given to US adults (aged 18-64) via email and all responses were kept anonymous. 
  - **7282 participants** with the following characteristics:
    - 47.8% men and 51.8% women
    - 4.7% High income (>$150K USD), 25.8% Middle income ($60K-$150K USD), 65.4% Low income (<$60K USD)
      - Participants reported their household income and were divided into income levels based on the cutoffs above
  - Well-being measures
    - Life satisfaction was measured using statements such as *“I am satisfied with my life”* and participants marked how much they agreed.
    - Loneliness was measured using questions such as *"How often do you feel left out?"* and participants marked a general frequency.
  - Data analysis
    - Differences in the average level of each well-being measure for men and women were compared to see if there was a significant sex difference. This was done at each income level for each well-being measure.
      - For example, the average level of loneliness for men with low income was compared to the average level of loneliness for women with low income to see if there was a difference between the two. This was repeated for men and women at the middle- and high-income levels and then for life satisfaction.
    
**What were the findings?**

<ins>Life Satisfaction</ins>
  - Women were more satisfied with life than men at the low-income level (<$60K USD).
  - Men and women at the middle-income level ($60K-$150K USD) were equally satisfied with life
  - It looks like men were more satisfied in life than women at the high-income level (>$150K USD), but this difference was not "significant". This is likely because there were fewer participants in the high-income group, so it is more likely this difference is due to chance.

<ins>Loneliness</ins>
  - Men and women at the low-income level (<$60K USD) were equally lonely.
  - At the middle- ($60K-$150K USD) and high-income (>$150K USD) levels, women were lonelier than men.
