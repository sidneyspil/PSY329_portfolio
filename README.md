# About me
Hi there, my name is Sidney, and I am a third-year student in the Psychology Specialists program at the University of Toronto.
## About this page
This past semester, I took a **social psychology lab course** where I got to do a research project using free-to-use data collected by previous researchers (also known as an open-source data set). This page presents my findings in an accessible way that is understandable to anyone. I hope you enjoy it and learn something new!
## My Project
### How do men and women differ in life satisfaction and loneliness within income levels?
This study examined the differences between men and women on their levels of life satisfaction and loneliness within low, middle, and high-income levels.

**Why ask this question?**

<ins>Past research has found that:</ins>  
  - Women tend to be more satisfied with life than men (Joshanloo & Jovanovic, 2020).
  - People with higher incomes tend to be more satisfied with life (Joshanloo & Jovanovic, 2020).
  - Men and women tend to be equally lonely (Maes et al., 2019).

*These findings are very general, so more research is needed to understand how income and sex work together to impact these measures of well-being.*

This brought me to my research, where I looked at sex differences in loneliness and life satisfaction within specific income levels to get a deeper understanding. 

**How was this question answered?**
Basic description of the data: what dataset is used, sample size, how the data is collected in the original study. Clearly state how the analytic method and variables used match the question.
  - For my project, I used data collected from the **ICPR 2022 National Wellbeing Survey**, which is a survey given to US adults (aged 18-64) via email where responses are kept anonymously (Monnat et al., 2024).
  - The survey collects demographic and well-being information, such as questions about loneliness and satisfaction with life, and allows anyone to access the data for research purposes.
  - For survey respondents to qualify for my study, they had to have answered the questions regarding sex, household income, life satisfaction, and loneliness. This left me with 7282 participants, 47.8% of which were men and 51.8% were women.
