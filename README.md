# About me
Hi there, my name is Sidney, and I am a third-year student in the Psychology Specialists program at the University of Toronto.
## About this page
This past semester, I took a **social psychology lab course** where I got to do a research project using free-use data collected by previous researchers (also known as an open-source data set)

This page presents my findings in an accessible way that is understandable to anyone. I hope you enjoy it and learn something!
