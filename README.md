# About me
Hi there, my name is Sidney, and I am a third-year student in the Psychology Specialists program at the University of Toronto.
## About this page
This past semester, I took a **social psychology lab course** where I got to do a research project using free-to-use data collected by previous researchers (also known as an open-source data set). This page presents my findings in an accessible way that is understandable to anyone. I hope you enjoy it and learn something new!
## My Project
### How do men and women differ in life satisfaction and loneliness within income levels?
This study examined the differences between men and women on their levels of life satisfaction and loneliness within low, middle, and high-income levels.

**Why ask this question?**

<ins>Past research has found that:</ins>  
  - Women tend to be more satisfied with life than men (Joshanloo & Jovanovic, 2020).
  - People with higher incomes tend to be more satisfied with life (Joshanloo & Jovanovic, 2020).
  - Men and women tend to be equally lonely (Maes et al., 2019).

*These findings are very general, so more research is needed to understand how income and sex work together to impact these measures of well-being.*

This brought me to my research, where I specifically looked at sex differences in loneliness and life satisfaction within specific income levels to get a deeper understanding.
