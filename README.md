# About me
Hi there, my name is Sidney, and I am a third-year student in the Psychology Specialists program at the University of Toronto.
## About this page
This past semester, I took a **social psychology lab course** where I got to do a research project using free-to-use data collected by previous researchers (also known as an open-source data set). This page presents my findings in an accessible way that is understandable to anyone. I hope you enjoy it and learn something new!
## My Project
### How do men and women differ in life satisfaction and loneliness within income levels?
This study examined the differences between men and women on their levels of life satisfaction and loneliness within low, middle, and high-income levels.

**Why ask this question?**

<ins>Past research has found that:</ins>  
  - Women tend to be more satisfied with life than men (Joshanloo & Jovanovic, 2020).
  - People with higher incomes tend to be more satisfied with life (Joshanloo & Jovanovic, 2020).
  - Men and women tend to be equally lonely (Maes et al., 2019).

*These findings are very general, so more research is needed to understand how income and sex work together to impact these measures of well-being.*

This brought me to my research, where I looked at sex differences in loneliness and life satisfaction within specific income levels to get a deeper understanding. 

**How was this question answered?**
Basic description of the data: what dataset is used, sample size, how the data is collected in the original study. Clearly state how the analytic method and variables used match the question.
  - For my project, I used data collected from the **ICPR 2022 National Wellbeing Survey** (Monnat et al., 2024)
  - This survey was given to US adults (aged 18-64) via email and all responses were kept anonymous. 
  - With the data collected by the survey, I ended up with 7282 participants, 47.8% of which were men and 51.8% were women.
    - Participants reported their household income
    - Participants reported their sex
    - Life satisfaction was measured using statements such as *“I am satisfied with my life”* and participants marked how much they agreed.
    - Loneliness was measured using questions such as *"How often do you feel left out?"* and participants marked a general frequency>
